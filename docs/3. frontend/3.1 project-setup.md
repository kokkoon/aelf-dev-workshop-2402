# Project Setup
To begin, letâ€™s clone the frontend project repository from GitHub. Proceed to run the following command in the **capstone_aelf** directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/clement-stackup/StackUp_DAO.git
```

Next, proceed to navigate to the frontend project directory by running the following command.

```
cd StackUp_DAO
```

Once you are in the **StackUp_DAO** directory, proceed to open the project with your desired IDE (i.e VSCode) and you should observe the following as shown below.

Before we begin writing the code for the respective frontend components, we will first need to install the necessary libraries and dependencies!

To do so, proceed to run the following command on the terminal.

```
npm install
```

We are now ready to build the frontend components of our Voting dApp!
