Upon clicking on the localhost URL, you should be directed to the StackUpDAO landing page as shown below!

:::tip
If you are developing and testing this with GitHub codespace, you can use Port Forward to test the web server that is running in codespace, here is the link on how to use Port forward for codespace https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace
:::

Usually codespace will automatically forward port, you should see a pop-up message at the bottom right of your codespace browser window as shown in the diagram below:
