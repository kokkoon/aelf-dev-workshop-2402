# Voting dApp (Frontend)

**Project Preview**

We will be building out the frontend components of our Voting dApp in this quest! Before we dive into the coding aspects, here’s a preview of what you will be building throughout this quest.

The Voting dApp will comprise 2 pages namely the landing page and create proposal page!

**Landing Page**

Application which will first allow users to connect to the application using their Portkey wallet!

Next, users will be able to join the DAO by clicking on “Join DAO”. Once the user has successfully joined the DAO, they will be able to create proposals and vote on proposals created by other members of the DAO!

**Create Proposal Page**

This is the “Create Proposal” page of our Voting dApp application which allows users to fill in details of their proposal such as the title, description and the vote threshold (votes required for the proposal to pass).

Now that you have a better understanding of what we will be building, let’s set up the project!
