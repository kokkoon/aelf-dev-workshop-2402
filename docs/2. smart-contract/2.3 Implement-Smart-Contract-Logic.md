# Implement Voting Smart Contract Logic

In this step, we will be implementing the logic of our voting smart contract in the **src/BuilderspDAO.cs** file!

## Smart Contract Logics

Proceed to overwrite the existing contents of the current file with the following code snippet.

```csharp showLineNumbers
using AElf.Sdk.CSharp;
using AElf.Sdk.CSharp.State;
using AElf.Types;
using Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Security.Principal;

namespace AElf.Contracts.BuildersDAO
{
    public class BuildersDAO : BuildersDAOContainer.BuildersDAOBase
    {
        const string author = "REPLACE PLACEHOLDER HERE";

        //Step 1 - Implement Initialize Smart Contract Logic 
        public override Empty Initialize(Empty input) {}

        // Step 2 - Implement Join DAO Logic 
        public override Empty JoinDAO(Address input) {}

        // Step 3 - Implement Create Proposal Logic 
        public override Proposal CreateProposal(CreateProposalInput input) {}

        //Step 4 - Implement Vote on Proposal Logic 
        public override Proposal VoteOnProposal(VoteInput input) {}
        
        //Step 5 - Implement Get All Proposals Logic
        public override ProposalList GetAllProposals(Empty input) {}
     }    
  }
```
To begin, let’s first fill in the **author** string variable with a unique name.

:::warning
Aelf Sidechain does not recognise duplicate smart contracts hence we will be using the **author** variable as the unique identifier for our voting smart contract!

## Initialize Function

Next, proceed to head over to the comment `//Step 1 - Implement Initialize Smart Contract Logic` where we will be implementing the Initialize functionality!

In this function, we will first check if the smart contract has been already initialized and return if the smart contract has already been initialized!

Next, we will define a hardcoded proposal for demonstration purposes, parsing in the necessary parameters such as the id, title, description and more!

Next, we will update our Proposals state variable with our hardcoded proposal and increment the proposalId.

With a better understanding of how the function works, proceed to populate the **Initialize** function with the following code snippet.

```csharp showLineNumbers
//Step 1 - Implement Initialize Smart Contract Logic 
public override Empty Initialize(Empty input) {
            Assert(!State.Initialized.Value, "already initialized");
            var initialProposal = new Proposal
            {
                Id = "0",
                Title = "Proposal #1",
                Description = "This is the first proposal of the DAO",
                Status = "IN PROGRESS",
                VoteThreshold = 1,            
            };
            State.Proposals[initialProposal.Id] = initialProposal;
            State.NextProposalId.Value = 1;
            State.MemberCount.Value = 0;
            return new Empty();
}
```
## Join DAO Function

Next, proceed to head over to the comment `//Step 2 - Implement Join DAO Logic` where we will be implementing the Join DAO functionality!

In this function, we will first check if the member is already part of the DAO by checking the Members mapped state variable. If the member is not part of the DAO, we will then update the Members state variable to true based on the user’s address.

We will then increment the membersCount state variable to represent the latest count of members in the DAO!

With a better understanding of how the function works, proceed to populate the **JoinDAO** function with the following code snippet.

```csharp showLineNumbers
//Step 2 - Implement Join DAO Logic 
public override Empty JoinDAO(Address input) {
            Assert(!State.Members[input], "Member is already in the DAO");
            State.Members[input] = true;
         
            var currentCount = State.MemberCount.Value;
            State.MemberCount.Value = currentCount + 1;
            return new Empty();
}
```
## Create Proposal Function

Next, proceed to head over to the comment `//Step 3 - Implement Create Proposal Logic` where we will be implementing the Create Proposal functionality!

In this function, we first check if the user is a member of the DAO as only members of the DAO are able to create proposals!

Next, we will create a new proposal object parsing in the fields from the “CreateProposalInput” message definition from our **BuildersDAO.proto** file.

We will then update the Proposals state variable with the newly created proposal object, increment the **NextProposalId** state variable and return the newly created proposal object.

With a better understanding of how the function works, proceed to populate the **CreateProposal** function with the following code snippet.

```csharp showLineNumbers
//Step 3 - Implement Create Proposal Logic 
public override Proposal CreateProposal(CreateProposalInput input) {
            Assert(State.Members[input.Creator], "Only DAO members can create proposals");
            var proposalId = State.NextProposalId.Value.ToString();
            var newProposal = new Proposal
            {
                Id = proposalId,
                Title = input.Title,
                Description = input.Description,
                Status = "IN PROGRESS",
                VoteThreshold = input.VoteThreshold,
                YesVotes = {},  // Initialize as empty
                NoVotes = {},   // Initialize as empty
            };
            State.Proposals[proposalId] = newProposal;
            State.NextProposalId.Value += 1;
            return newProposal; // Ensure return
}
```
## Vote On Proposal Function

Next, proceed to head over to the comment `//Step 4 - Implement Vote on Logic` where we will be implementing the Vote on Proposal functionality!

In this function, we will first perform the following checks:

- Check if the member is already a member of the DAO as only DAO members can vote on a proposal
- Check if the proposal to be voted on exists otherwise return an error message that the proposal is not found
- Check if the member has already voted on the specific proposal as only DAO members can only vote once on the proposal
If the member passes the following checks, we will then store the member’s vote and update the proposal state.

At the same time, we will also check if the updated votes count has reached the current vote threshold whereby if the yesVotes count reaches the vote threshold, the status of the proposal will be updated to **“PASSED”**.

Similarly, if the noVotes count has reached the threshold, the status of the proposal will be updated to **“DENIED”**.

With a better understanding of how the function works, proceed to populate the **VoteOnProposal** function with the following code snippet.

```csharp showLineNumbers
//Step 4 - Implement Vote on Proposal Logic 
public override Proposal VoteOnProposal(VoteInput input) {
            Assert(State.Members[input.Voter], "Only DAO members can vote");
            var proposal = State.Proposals[input.ProposalId]; // ?? new proposal
            Assert(proposal != null, "Proposal not found");
            Assert(!proposal.YesVotes.Contains(input.Voter) && !proposal.NoVotes.Contains(input.Voter), "Member already voted");

            // Add the vote to the appropriate list
            if (input.Vote) {
            proposal.YesVotes.Add(input.Voter);
            } else {
            proposal.NoVotes.Add(input.Voter);
            }

            // Update the proposal in state
            State.Proposals[input.ProposalId] = proposal;

            // Check if the proposal has reached its vote threshold
            if (proposal.YesVotes.Count >= proposal.VoteThreshold) {
            proposal.Status = "PASSED";
            } else if (proposal.NoVotes.Count >= proposal.VoteThreshold) {
            proposal.Status = "DENIED";
            }
            
            return proposal;
}
```

## Get All Proposals Function

Lastly, proceed to head over to the comment `//Step 5 - Implement Get All Proposals Logic` which allows us to retrieve the list of proposals created by members of the DAO!

This is implemented by first creating a new ProposalList object as defined from the message definition from the **BuildersDAO.proto** file.

Next, we will fetch and loop through the Proposals state variable and update the ProposalList object with the proposal objects and finally return the list of proposals!

With a better understanding of how the function works, proceed to populate the **GetAllProposals** function with the following code snippet.

```csharp showLineNumbers
//Step 5 - Implement Get All Proposals Logic 
public override ProposalList GetAllProposals(Empty input) {     
            var proposals = new ProposalList();
            for (int i = 0; i < State.NextProposalId.Value; i++)
            {
                var proposal_count = i.ToString();
                var proposal = State.Proposals[proposal_count];
                proposals.Proposals.Add(proposal);
            }
            return proposals;
}
```

With that, we have implemented all the functionalities of our Voting dApp smart contract!

In the next step, we will compile our smart contract and deploy our written smart contract to the aelf Sidechain!
