# Project Setup

First, proceed to create a new project folder and navigate to the project root directory by running the following commands.

```
mkdir capstone_aelf && cd capstone_aelf
```

Next, proceed to run the following command to create the capstone project!

```
dotnet new aelf -n StackUpDAO
```

Proceed to open the project on your desired IDE (VSCode) and rename the existing **src/Protobuf/contract/hello_world_contract.proto** file to **StackUpDAO.proto**!

Once you have renamed the file, hereâ€™s how your working directory should look like!

Preview of Working Directory
Under the **src/Protobuf** folder, proceed to create a new folder and name it **reference**.

In the reference folder, proceed to create a new file titled **acs12.proto** and paste the following code snippet into the **acs12.proto** file.

```protobuf showLineNumbers
/**
 * AElf Standards ACS12(User Contract Standard)
 *
 * Used to manage user contract.
 */
 syntax = "proto3";
 
package acs12;

 import public "aelf/options.proto";
 import public "google/protobuf/empty.proto";
 import public "google/protobuf/wrappers.proto";
 
 option (aelf.identity) = "acs12";
 option csharp_namespace = "AElf.Standards.ACS12";
 
 service UserContract{
 };
 
 //Specified method fee for user contract.
 message UserContractMethodFees {
     // List of fees to be charged.
     repeated UserContractMethodFee fees = 2;
     // Optional based on the implementation of SetConfiguration method.
     bool is_size_fee_free = 3;
 }
 
 message UserContractMethodFee {
     // The token symbol of the method fee.
     string symbol = 1;
     // The amount of fees to be charged.
     int64 basic_fee = 2;
 }
 ```

The **acs12.proto** file will be referenced in the upcoming steps and is used to manage user contracts and fees implementation within our voting smart contract

With that, we have successfully created our project!

In the next step, we will be implementing the services, messages and state definitions of our voting smart contract!
