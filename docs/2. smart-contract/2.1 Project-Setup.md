# Project Setup

First, proceed to create a new project folder and navigate to the project root directory by running the following commands.

```
mkdir capstone_aelf && cd capstone_aelf
```

Next, proceed to run the following command to create the capstone project!

```
dotnet new aelf -n BuildersDAO
```

Proceed to open the project on your desired IDE (VSCode) and rename the existing **src/Protobuf/contract/hello_world_contract.proto** file to **BuildersDAO.proto**!

Once you have renamed the file, hereâ€™s how your working directory should look like!

With that, we have successfully created our project!
