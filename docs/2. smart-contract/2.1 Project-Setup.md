# Project Setup

First, proceed to create a new project folder and navigate to the project root directory by running the following commands.

```
mkdir capstone_aelf && cd capstone_aelf
```

Next, proceed to run the following command to create the capstone project!

```
dotnet new aelf -n StackUpDAO
```

Proceed to open the project on your desired IDE (VSCode) and rename the existing **src/Protobuf/contract/hello_world_contract.proto** file to **StackUpDAO.proto**!

Once you have renamed the file, hereâ€™s how your working directory should look like!

With that, we have successfully created our project!

In the next step, we will be implementing the services, messages and state definitions of our voting smart contract!
